Writing is thinking. When you write clearly, you think clearly.

The best writing is simple. Use short sentences. Avoid jargon. Say what you mean.

## Start with the idea

Before you write, know what you want to say. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

## Edit ruthlessly

First drafts are always too long. Cut everything that doesn't add meaning. Every word should earn its place.

## Read it aloud

If a sentence sounds awkward when spoken, rewrite it. Good prose has rhythm.
